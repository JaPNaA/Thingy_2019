This project uses the Tensorflow library and trains a model to classify handwriten digits.

~~Unfortuntely, I couldn't get the model to accurately predict user-generated digits, and maybe one day I'll get that to work, but I've spent too much time on this to just discard it.~~

Update 2021: I've come back and updated it. It's using Tensorflow 2 now, but more importantly, it WORKS (most of the time)!

Unfortunately app requires a Python server, so you're going to have to download and set it up yourself if you want to see it's glorly.
