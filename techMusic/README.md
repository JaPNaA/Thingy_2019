# TechMusic

This project was created to make a boring process of syncing LEDs to music faster and less boring.

This project has many bugs and doesn't work the best, but it's good enough to have minimal manual effort make sure they sync.

Some files in this this project have been removed due to copyright:
  - livinonaprayer.mp3
  - nothingelsematters.mp3

You can download these MP3s somewhere else on the web, and place them in data/music if you want to get it working.
