# TechMusic

This project was created to make a boring process of syncing LEDs to music, manually, using PICAXE BASIC faster and less boring. It does this by doing it for you, given the parts where it should light the LED up.

This project has many bugs and doesn't work the best, but it's good enough to have minimal manual effort make sure they sync.

## How to use

### Keyboard Controls

As this was rushed together, the keyboard controls aren't really _intuitive_.
